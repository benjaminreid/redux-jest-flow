Experiments with testing Redux and integrating Flow

## Installation

Run `npm install` and you should then have everything you need.

### Usage

* Preview the Flow typed JavaScript with [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) Atom plugin (or any other Flow supported editor).
* Run the tests with `npm run test:watch` (this works particularly well something like [terminal-plus](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-plus) as you can see you're tests passing/failing without leaving your editor).
